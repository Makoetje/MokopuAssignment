Student Dropout Prediction System

Project Overview
This machine learning project predicts student dropout risk using Random Forest classification. The system analyzes academic performance, financial status, and demographic factors to classify students into three categories: Dropout, Enrolled, or Graduate.

Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outliers, and feature selection
- Random Forest Model: With hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
- Bootstrap Validation: Confidence intervals for model performance
- Interactive Dashboard: Streamlit web application for predictions
- Comprehensive Analytics: Feature importance, confusion matrices, and performance metrics

Dataset
The model uses student academic data with features including:
- Academic performance (grades, approved units)
- Financial status (tuition fees, scholarships)
- Demographic information (age, gender, course)
- Family background and economic factors

Model Performance
- Accuracy: >85% on test set
- Cross-validation: 5-fold stratified CV
- Bootstrap CI: 95% confidence intervals
- Feature Selection: Random Forest importance-based
